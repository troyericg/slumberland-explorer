Do you hear?\r\nOomp: His name is Somnus and he's as gentle as can be.\r\nCaption: Nemo was surprised as well as delighted to receive the king's invitation, so he scrambled out of bed and mounted the prancing pony which now appeared.\r\nCaption: \"Slumberland is a long way off through many miles of weird scenes,\" said Oomp. \"But be good to your horse and you will arrive there safe and sound.\"\r\nOomp: Slumberland is the most wonderful place in the sky.

What is that? \r\nOomp: Be kind to him, I warn you.\r\nCaption: Nemo obeyed until he came up with a green kangaroo who challenged him to a race. He accepted because he thought it would be easy to win with Somnus.\r\nKangaroo: I'll race you to Moontown.
