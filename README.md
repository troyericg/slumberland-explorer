A way to explore Zachary Chavez's [archive of public domain comic strips](http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/about), specifically, ["Little Nemo in Slumberland"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo).

Completely based on The New York Times' [Red Carpet Project](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/oscars/red-carpet-history/).
